# Project Motivation
Due to the current global circumstances, I believed that taking the "CoronaVirus" issue into consideration is a duty, and that people should know the seriousness of the current situation in order to take the necessary measures, so I wanted to discuss these questions:
1.How does the virus spread ?
2.What is the virus's death rate ?
3.What is the virus's recovered rate ?
4.How to protect our selves and people we love ?

# File Descriptions
